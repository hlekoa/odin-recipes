    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fresh cranberry sauce is a must for your Thanksgiving dinner. Made with just 3 ingredients, this easy cranberry sauce is perfect alongside turkey but it can also be used as filling for cranberry
         and cream cheese tarts or a tasty topping on bagels, cornbread, or cheesecake.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>The best things in life are often the simplest - and this fresh cranberry sauce, made with just three ingredients, is proof:</p>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 package fresh cranberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below:</p>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and sauce is chunky,
        about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency.  The longer you cook it, the less chunky it will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use; the pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Mix cranberry sauce with fork before serving.</li>
